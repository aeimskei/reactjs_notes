# Route Parameters

* They're a part of a URL that can change
* We usually see them on URLs for individual records like the following:

Examples:

* User's Profile Page: myboard.com/users/**rider01**
* User's Profile Page: myboard.com/users/**maybear91**
* Cooking Recipe Page: chefsboard.com/recipes/**cookies**
* Cooking Recipe Page: chefsboard.com/recipes/**brownies**

As you can see the beginning portion stays the same, but the ends are different. Also, each page template is gonna be the same, but the data shown is different based on the URL, the ending, what it represents.

Those endings of a URL are the **Route Parameters**
