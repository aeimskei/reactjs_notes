# Single Page Apps and File Structure

Typically, a lot of React Apps are **single page apps** as well. However, that doesn't mean that our user on our site only ever see's one page with the same content - it means that there will only be one HTML page that is served to the browser from the server, and then we dynamically update the content on that page, dependent on the user's interaction with the website and what URL that they visit.

* React apps are typically single page apps
* They're only on one HTML page served to the browser and updated dynamically based on the user's interaction with the website or app
* React then controls what the user sees on the page
