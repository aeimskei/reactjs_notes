# Using Axios

Usually with a website we want to be grabbing data and showing it on our website. Rhis could be from some kind of REST API on your server of some other third party API, or a service like Firbase that goes directly to the database.

In this example to practice, we'll use a third party REST API to get some dummy data from. We're gonna use JSON Placeholder: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

JSON Placeholder will give us access to some REST API endpoints to receive some dummy data.

## How to Get and Use the Data - Using Axios

We're gonna use **Axios** an HTTP Request Library. We'll need to install it as a separate package to our continuing ```routeapp``` example. In the terminal ```npm install axios```
